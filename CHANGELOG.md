### 2.1.0

This release fixes a bug that might put the iOS Simulator into a bad state.
An iOS Simulator could potentially have a .app installed in its directory
structure, but the app would not appear in Springboard or be detected by
simctl.  We have fixed the bug for Xcode 7.  There is no possible fix for
Xcode 6.  In order to ensure that your iOS Simulators are in a good shape we
recommend that all users run:

```
# Will take ~10 minutes depending on the number of installed simulators.
#
# Don't forget to run this on your CI machines.
#
# You only have to run this command once!
$ DEBUG=1 run-loop simctl doctor
```

I apologize for the inconvenience, this mistake is on me. -jjm
